GitHub Markup
=============
This Library can be used to login in your linkedin account using codeigniter(PHP) framework.

Please note that **only the first step** is covered by this gem â€” the rest happens on GitHub.com.  In particular, `markup` itself does no sanitization of the resulting HTML, as it expects that to be covered by whatever pipeline is consuming the HTML.

GitHub Markup
=============

This library is the first step of a journey that every markup file in a repository goes on before it is rendered on GitHub.com:

1. This Library can be used to login in your linkedin account using codeigniter(PHP) framework.

Please note that **only the first step** is covered by this gem â€” the rest happens on GitHub.com.  In particular, `markup` itself does no sanitization of the resulting HTML, as it expects that to be covered by whatever pipeline is consuming the HTML.

Please see our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before reporting an issue.
